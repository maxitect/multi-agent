# Multi-Agent Web App Development MCP Workflow

## MCP Server Architecture for Web App Development

### 1. Conception Agent MCP Server

  - Retrieve project templates
  - Access requirement gathering tools
  - Generate initial project specification
  - Interface with market research databases
- **Input Interfaces**:
  - Natural language project description
  - High-level business objectives
- **Output**:
  - Structured project specification document
  - Initial requirement analysis

### 2. Architecture Agent MCP Server

- **Capabilities**:
  - Access system design tools
  - Generate architecture decision records (ADR)
  - Interact with technology comparison databases
  - Validate architectural feasibility
- **Input Interfaces**:
  - Project specification from Conception Agent
  - Technology constraint parameters
- **Output**:
  - Detailed architecture design
  - Technology stack recommendations
  - Architecture decision record

### 3. Project Standards Agent MCP Server

- **Capabilities**:
  - Access coding standard repositories
  - Generate project-specific coding guidelines
  - Create implementation plan template
  - Validate against industry best practices
- **Input Interfaces**:
  - Architecture design
  - Organisational coding standards
- **Output**:
  - Comprehensive coding standards document
  - Detailed implementation plan
  - Quality assurance checklist

### 4. UI/UX Agent MCP Server

  - Interface with development environments
- **Input Interfaces**:
  - Specification documents
  - Design guidelines
  - Coding standards
- **Output**:
  - Generated source code
  - Initial test suite
  - Code repository setup

### 6. Deployment Agent MCP Server

- **Capabilities**:
  - Generate infrastructure as code
  - Configure cloud deployment settings
  - Set up CI/CD pipelines
  - Manage environment configurations
- **Input Interfaces**:
  - Implementation artifacts
  - Deployment requirements
- **Output**:
  - Deployment scripts
  - Infrastructure configuration
  - Initial deployment setup

## Workflow Information Flow

1. Conception Agent creates initial specification via MCP
2. Specification passed to Architecture Agent through MCP
3. Architecture Agent generates ADR, passed to Standards Agent
4. Standards Agent creates implementation guidelines
5. UI/UX Agent generates design artifacts
6. Implementation Agent uses all previous artifacts to generate code
7. Deployment Agent sets up infrastructure and deployment pipeline

## Security and Governance Considerations

- Each MCP server has restricted permissions
- Mandatory human review between major stages
- Logging of all inter-agent communications
- Ability to pause or modify workflow at each stage

## Extensibility

- Modular design allows adding or replacing agent MCP servers
- Standard interface for new tools or development approaches
- Ability to swap out individual components without disrupting entire workflow

## Future Improvements

- Add intelligent routing between agents
- Implement more sophisticated error handling
- Create a central MCP gateway for workflow management
